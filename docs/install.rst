=============================
Clone this repository from Github and install with ::

    pip install -e .

This package currently supports both Python 2.6+ and Python 3+

Note: this package relies heavily on two dependencies:

    1. ``latticeproteins`` : lattice protein simulator written by Jesse Bloom, forked by Zsailer.
    2. ``seqspace`` : python package for constructing genotype-phenotype map datatypes.
