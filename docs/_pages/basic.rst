The basics
==========
Use ``latticegpm`` to create genotype-phenotype maps from protein lattice model
simulations. The phenotypes could be either folding stability, total energy of the native
state, or fitness (fraction folded). Then, run evolution simulations on the
genotype-phenotype maps.


Create the the space through one of the following methods.
    * `Build from a set of mutations`_
    * `Build from a set of genotypes`_
    * `Build from random sequences with given length`_
