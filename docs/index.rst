LatticeGPM Documentation
======================================

``latticegpm`` contains various methods and classes for constructing genotype-phenotype maps
from 2d lattice protein models. Genotypes are represented by lattice protein
chains comprised of 20 amino acids, or polar/non-polar (HP model) chains. Possible phenotypes
are folding stability, fraction folded, peptide binding affinity, or fitness.
